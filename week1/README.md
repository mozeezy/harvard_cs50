## Week 1

## Data Types in C

- char: a single character
- int: integer
- float: decimal numbers
- double: stores decimal numbers with double precision

- Unlike JavaSript, in C, when declaring a variable, we need to specify its type.

## Operators

- "+" -> addition
- "-" -> subtraction
- "*" -> multiplication
- "/" -> division
- "%" -> remainder

## Conditionals

- conditionals are evaluations that the program makes. it utilizes boolean expressions to determine the course of actions.
  - in real life, it would be similar to stopping at a gas station to fill up your vehicle.
  - the thought process is: "if my car is low in gas, stop at a gas station"
  - in programming,
      if (gas < x) {printf("Stop at a gas station!");}
- For multiple conditional statements, we utilize if-else if statements.

## Loops
- loops are ways to iterate over data without having to repeat lines of code.
- In C, there are many kinds of loops.
  - While loop: while(condition = true) {run this block}
  - Do while loop: do {run this block} while (condition = true)
  - For loop: for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {run this block}
